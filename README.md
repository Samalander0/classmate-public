# Classmate

Classmate is an AI-powered essay feedback tool. Check it out at [classmate.app](https://www.classmate.app)!

This repo contains all of the frontend of Classmate and a majority of the backend as well.

## Developing
Classmate uses Node/SvelteKit, with a Pocketbase backend. To use, you'll need to set up a Pocketbase backend (I use Railway), and you'll also need Google OAuth keys and an OpenAI API key.

If you have any questions about development, or would like to create something similar, feel free to reach out to me on Discord @samaland3r or via email at sam@samcheng.co
